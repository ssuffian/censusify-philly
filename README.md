This is a library that helps map census demographics (or really any census data) mappable to geographies specific to Philadelphia using geojson files available from Open Data Philly.

## Police Service Areas

An explanatory notebook is [here](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/scripts/Explanation%20of%20Mapping%20Census%20Data%20to%20Police%20Geographies.ipynb) to explain the ways that demographic data gets mapped to Police Service Areas.

If you just want the demographics by PSA (using the % area method described in the notebook above) then you can find the CSV files here ([PSA](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/scripts/psa_demographics.csv), [district](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/scripts/district_demographics.csv), [division](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/scripts/division_demographics.csv)).
