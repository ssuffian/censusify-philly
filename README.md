This is a library that helps map census demographics (or really any census data) mappable to geographies specific to Philadelphia using geojson files available from Open Data Philly.

## Police Service Areas

An explanatory notebook is [here](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/scripts/Explanation%20of%20Mapping%20Census%20Data%20to%20Police%20Geographies.ipynb) to explain the ways that demographic data gets mapped to Police Service Areas.

If you just want the demographics by PSA, you can download [by % area overlap](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/src/censusify_philly/csvs/police_service_area__pct_overlap.csv) or [by census block group centroid](https://github.com/ssuffian/censusify-philly/blob/main/src/censusify_philly/csvs/police_service_area__centroid_is_within.csv)
